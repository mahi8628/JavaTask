This project aims to create the file dynamically,depends on the size and content and returns the string randomly.
After the file creation it reads 3000 characters and read the file to check the length of the characters.
Checking the frequency of character is achieved by looping.
res = res + alphabet[(int) (Math.random() * 10 % MAX)];
